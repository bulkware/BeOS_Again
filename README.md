# BeOS Again

An XFCE theme based on the [BeOS R5 operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BeOS). The theme was originally published on [gnome-look.org](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1214415/) in 2018. I created this repository so I can take this theme forward and track the development, which is not really practical to do on gnome-look.org.

## Metsatron
At least one individual has cloned my original theme and taken it forward. It is located in [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) under username [Metsatron](https://gitlab.com/metsatron/BeOS-r5-XFWM). Metsatron has taken the theme a step forward by adding several repositories for BeOS R5 related material. The best examples of Metsatron's work is a repository for [BeOS R5 icon set](https://gitlab.com/metsatron/BeOS-r5-Icons) and a [dockbar](https://gitlab.com/metsatron/BeOS-dr8-DockbarX). Personally I think Metsatron's work is fantastic.

## Installation of the Xfwm theme

Create a directory for Xfwm themes:
`mkdir -p ~/.themes`

Copy theme into themes directory:
`cp -r BeOS_Again-master/themes/BeOS_Again ~/.themes`
